## Description

EVKendra is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the election process.  It provides a secure and user-friendly platform for voters to cast their ballots and for administrators to manage elections, candidates, and voter registration. The application utilizes a client-side React framework for a dynamic user interface and a Node.js backend with Express.js for handling API requests and database interactions.  The primary use case is to provide a secure and transparent online voting system, offering a unique value proposition of ease of use for both voters and administrators.  Key functions include user authentication, election creation and management, vote casting, and result aggregation.
